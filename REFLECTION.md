 # Reflection on *readingTracker.js*

- What was the most helpful aspect of this code's structure?
	- Ironically the most helpful aspect was also the hardest to understand, namely the for loop that calculated maxBook after going through a fair amount of sausage-making.  But this is sausage that is helpful to understand what is being consumed, particularly because it highlights the beauty of more direct and artful approaches to achieving that result (which we have yet to learn, but which I'm quite sure exist).

- What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
	- Seeing the sausage get made was confusing at first, in the sense that it was not immediately apparent what was going on, unlike some of the very direct elements like functions that print a summary, or the arrays that represent the initial ingestion of data.  The confusion is part of the learning process, however, and it requires students to think through how the information wends its way through the code to emerge as a whole (meat in tube form!).
